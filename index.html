        <p>- Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being.</p>
	<p>Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the
	stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn and work well, and contribute to their community.</p>
	<p>Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as
	well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning,
	or risk of self-harm. Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively 
	low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide
	all over the world.</p>
	<p>MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION AND PREVENTION:</p>
	<p>Promotion and prevention efforts aim to improve mental health by addressing individual, social
	and structural determinants of mental health. Interventions can be designed for individuals, 
	specific groups or whole populations.
	<p>Suicide prevention is a global priority and part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Key 
	strategies include limiting access to means, promoting responsible media reporting, supporting social 
	and emotional learning for adolescents, and ensuring early intervention. Banning highly hazardous 
	pesticides is a particularly inexpensive and cost–effective intervention for reducing suicide rates.

       WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH?</h>
	<p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act.
	It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every
	stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>
        <p>Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be
	 affected. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry,
	 life experiences, such as trauma or abuse, and family history of mental health problems.</p>
	<p>Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders
	 that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders,
	 schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.</p>
	<p>Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when
	 ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.</p>
	<p>A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in
	 relationships. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).</p>
